    In this project we attempt to build a realtime path planner satisfying a remote center of motion constraint.
    After ensuring the method will converge to a solution, the optimization objective is to minimize the total joint motion and to enforce motion limits on each joint.
    We set up a simulation using Open Roboticsâ€™ Gazebo to conduct our experiments in conjunction with the ROS platform.
    We worked to identify the challenges faced by planning in task space using Inverse-Kinematics.
    Sampling based methods were then used to improve the performance.
    Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of task space Inverse-Kinematics based methods.

    \chapter{INTRODUCTION}\label{ch:intro}


    \section{Motivation}\label{sec:motiv}
    Laparoscopic surgery, commonly know as `keyhole' surgery, is a procedure where a surgeon accesses the inside of
    the abdomen and pelvis without having to make a large incision.
    We are attempting to use a LBR iiwa 7~\cite{AG} arm produced by KUKA, which is a 7DOF robotic arm, to perform such a surgery.  % TODO: Add a reference?

    In this surgery, a small incision is made on the skin, and the surgical instruments are manipulated through that incision.
    We have model this as a cylindrical, and later circular, shape.
    The endeffector must always enter through the upper circular face and exit through the lower circular face.
    It must always pass through some volume of the cylinder and cannot intersect with the curved surface.
    An illustration can be seen in~\ref{fig:RCM}.
    This is quite similar to the `Remote Center of Motion' (RCM) constraint and henceforth, when we use the term RCM we will be referring to the aforementioned constraint.

    \begin{figure}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[height= 0.5\textwidth]{./img/rcm-constraint}
        \caption{A depiction of the Laproscopic surgery constraint as implemented in our work. The orange and gray objects are part of the robotic arm and the red cylinder represents the volume through which the end-effector must always pass.}
        \label{fig:RCM}
    \end{figure}

    We wished to implement a real-time path planner that can satisfy the RCM constraint.


    \section{Survey of Existing Methods}

    \subsection{Path Planners}
    Our survey of existing planning methods was primarily done by surveying the available algorithms in ROS MoveIT \cite{Coleman_Sucan_Chitta_Correll_2014}.
    This library provides a unified frontend to various motion planners and integrates wil the FCL collision checker, and with simulation and visualization software through the ROS framework.
    We must note that these planners are optimized for a general purpose use case.
    Our robot is very simple, and when it is inside the RCM, we observed that the links do not collide with each-other we do not require all the complexities and features of these full scale planners.

    % TODO: go into detail about different planners?

    A second technique can be used, wherein if we can generate a path in task space (i.e. in the coordinates of the tip of the end-effector),
    we can use Inverse Kinematics (IK) to generate the required joint angles in configuration space. This approach generally has the following problems.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Solving the IK problem may be slow
        \item There may be no IK solution for a given pose
        \item The IK solution will not be unique
        \item There may be large jumps in IK solutions between two consecutive points in the path.
    \end{enumerate}

    The Kinematics and Dynamics Library (KDL)~\cite{kdl-url} is default solver used by MoveIT for solving forward and inverse kinematics problems.
    We can also use the IKFast algorithm to generate analytical solutions for a given robot configuration.

    \subsection{7DOF Robot Control}

    Another challenge with working with this robot is its the over-actuated nature.
    To control the six DOF of the end-effector pose, we need to specify the joint angle of seven actuators.
    This leaves us with one extra DOF.
    In literature, we have seen others use that DOF to implement better obstacle avoidance~\cite{Doliwa_2020} and lock a single joint to get closed form kinematics~\cite{Asthana}
